        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>CropSense is a web-based platform built using
            Next.js to empower farmers with data-driven
            insights for smarter crop management.
            It provides crop recommendations, weather 
            forecasts, and soil health analysis to maximize
            yield and productivity. This project enhanced my 
            skills in full-stack development, API integration,
            and UI/UX design, while also deepening my interest
            in creating tech-driven solutions for the agriculture sector. ðŸš€ðŸŒ¾

        <p>
            Hangman is a guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player
            tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each letter that is not in the word,
            the first player draws a part of a hangman's gallows. The game continues until the word
            is guessed or the gallows is complete and the player who is guessing the word is "hanged."
            <br><br>
            In this project, we have created a simple implementation of the Hangman game using Python.
            The game allows the user to choose a category and then play the game by guessing letters.
            The game continues until the user guesses the word or runs out of chances.
